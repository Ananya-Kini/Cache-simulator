# Cache-simulator
Created a cache simulator using Python which accepts a sequence of memory trace as input, simulates the hit/miss behavior of a cache
memory on this trace, and outputs the total number of hits, misses, and evictions.

Implemented direct mapped cache and 2-way set associative cache.
